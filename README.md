# Hi, I'm Bill.

This repository contains the spaghetti I write during my off-time or inbetween software builds, when I'm not collecting airline miles or rolling dice.

## About me

My job description often include [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) ([CI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/)/[CD](https://www.jenkins.io/), [infrastructure](https://www.terraform.io/) [as](https://www.ansible.com/) [code](https://puppet.com/)), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), as well as things in the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) ecosystem, like [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [ECS](https://aws.amazon.\com/ecs/), [Elasticache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), [BigQuery], [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/), and [Bigquery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/). Talk to me about Python and anything ML.

I love examining aviation disasters for the interaction between the crew that affected the sequence of events that ultimately saved or doomed the plane. Some of my favourite incidents include the [disaster at Tenerife Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_airport_disaster), the accident of [United 232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_232) which hugely exceeded reasonable expectations, and the story of the development and service life of the [Concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde#Development).

In my off time, I love to challenge myself by [learning other languages](/talen), [travelling](/travel), and [creating worlds](http://roll20.net).
