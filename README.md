# Hi, I'm Bill.

This repository contains the spaghetti I write during my off-time or inbetween software builds, when I'm not collecting airline miles or rolling dice.

## About me

My job description often include [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), as well as things in the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) ecosystem. Talk to me about Python and anything ML.

I love examining aviation disasters for the interaction between the crew that affected the sequence of events that ultimately saved or doomed the plane. Some of my favourite incidents include the [disaster at Tenerife Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_airport_disaster), the accident of [United 232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_232) which hugely exceeded reasonable expectations, and the story of the development and service life of the [Concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde#Development).

In my off time, I love to challenge myself by [learning other languages](https://billxiong.com/talen), [travelling](https://billxiong.com/travel), and [creating worlds](https://roll20.net).
